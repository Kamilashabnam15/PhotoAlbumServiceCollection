# PhotoAlbumServiceCollection
Design of creating a RESTful API in ASP.NET Core. The API will call, combine, and return these 2 API endpoints into a single HTTP response. The response shows the combined collection so that each Album contains a collection of its Photo.
#Few improvements can be implemented
We can improve code by adding authentication since it is a open source i haven't implemented.
We can promote loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly by using mediator pattern.
And also can implement predefined exception types as well as custom exception.
can even simplify the client by moving logic for calling multiple services from the client using API gateway.
